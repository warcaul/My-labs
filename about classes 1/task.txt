Experimental data in the field of biotechnology are given. Make your program the user's choice:
1) Requested the input of experimental data from the keyboard
2) Downloaded experimental data from a file
Also, make your program the user's choice:
1) Output the results of the calculation to the console in the form of:
list of experimental data, the average value of the measured value
experimentally, and the root mean square error of the mean.
2) Recorded the results of the calculation in a file in the form: list
experimental data, the average value of the measured value
experimentally, and the root mean square error of the mean.
The code must include:
1) Lines of documentation, detailed comments
2) Class, which includes two methods of input
experimental data (keyboard and file) and input results
calculation (print to console and write to file)
3) A class that has a method of calculating the result.
